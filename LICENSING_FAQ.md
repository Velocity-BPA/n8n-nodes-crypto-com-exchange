No. If the infrastructure supports a revenue-generating service,
it is considered commercial use.

Visibility is irrelevant. Revenue enablement constitutes commercial use.

### What if we are a startup?
Startups are commercial entities and require a commercial license.

### What if we only use one workflow?
Scope does not change license requirements.

Internal, non-customer-facing POCs are permitted.
